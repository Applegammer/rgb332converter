## General info
8-bit RGB (also known as 3-3-2 bit RGB and 8-8-4 bit RGB)

The 3-3-2 bit RGB use 3 bits for each of the red and green color components, and 2 bits for the blue component, due to the eyes having lesser sensitivity to blue. This results in an 8×8×4 = 256-color palette

This palette is used by

* The MSX2 series of personal computers.
* Palette 4 of the IBM PGC (palette 2 gives 2-3-3 bit RGB and palette 3 gives 3-2-3 bit RGB).
* Enterprise Computer.
* Vector-06C, a home computer from the USSR.
* VGA built-in output of the Digilent Inc. NEXYS 2, NEXYS 3 and BASYS2 FPGA boards.
* The Uzebox gaming console
* SGI Indy 8-bit XL graphics
* The Tiki 100 personal computer (only 16 colors can be displayed simultaneously)
* Wear OS smartwatches with ambient displays (only 16 colors can be displayed simultaneously)
